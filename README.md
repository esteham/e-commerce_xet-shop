This project involves the creation and management of a database for an e-commerce platform. 
The `e_shopdb` database is designed to store and manage data related to an online shop, including:

1. **Products**: Information about the items available for sale, such as name, description, price, and stock quantity.
2. **Users**: Customer details, including registration information, login credentials, and purchase history.
3. **Orders**: Records of customer orders, including order status, payment details, and shipping information.
4. **Categories**: Organization of products into categories for easier navigation.
5. **Reviews**: Customer feedback and ratings for products.

The database is implemented using MySQL and is structured to ensure data integrity, scalability, and efficient querying.
This project can be used as a foundation for building a fully functional e-commerce website.

Feel free to explore and modify the database to suit your specific requirements.
